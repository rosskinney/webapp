						<h4>Discover</h4>
						<p>The first stage of the process is to define the exact goals of the project or business. The discovery phase clearly states the problem and contains all of the information needed. Understanding the business properly will allow us to develop a unique solution for you</p>

						<h4>Design</h4>
						<p>Now we begin to engage the creativity that is required to start developing focused design routes. Core choices about layout, type size and colour palettes are tested within a number of ideas to identify what works best in order to communicate your goals.</p>

						<br>
						<h4>Build</h4>
						<p>Once the design is signed off it is put into development. It is here where a working system that mimics the final design, is built with clean, semantic code that validates according to the W3C Organizations own community developed standards.</p>
